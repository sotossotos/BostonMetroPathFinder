## Communication:

In order to communicate effectively and efficiently we used a text based
instant messenger (Telegram).

For work synchronisation, we used <https://gitlab.cis.strath.ac.uk> where we
frequently committed changes with detailed descriptions. This, together with
Telegram - which we used to provide any further clarification we may need -
helped us to keep track of the work of each other. To keep track of the tasks we
still had to start or work on, we used the ‘Issues’ section within gitlab, and once
an issue had been completed we would indicate as such.

In order to enhance the project awareness amongst members, we had weekly
meetings in the lab. During these meetings we discussed current issues and
design approaches with the project development. Furthermore, we avoided writing
code during the group meetings since it could be done individually and then
checked by other group members for feedback via gitlab. Thus we mainly used the
meeting time to discuss our overall approach, implementation and feedback once
we received it based on our initial submission.

Most of the members were available to discuss about the project during any time
of the day which helped to continue the development without having long pauses.
